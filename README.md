Dec 2024 - Feb 2025Dec 2024 - Feb 2025
StockSphere is a full-stack web application and a clone of the popular Zerodha trading platform, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project features a responsive user interface that separates the signup/login process from the dashboard experience. Users can securely register, authenticate via JWT-based sessions, and access a protected dashboard where they can manage their portfolios and track real-time market data. Built with modern technologies and best practices, StockSphere demonstrates proficiency in RESTful API development, secure authentication, state management, and client-side routing.
